# #30DaysOfML

Welcome to the [@GDSCUIZ](https://gdsc.community.dev/university-of-ibn-zohr/) & [@TFUGAgadir](https://www.meetup.com/TFUGAgadir), [30 Days of Machine Learning](https://gdscuiz.github.io/30daysofml).

One of the hurdles that hiders self-learners is the language barrier. Instead of focusing on understanding the knowledge required, the learners put great effort into just understanding a single sentence of what's been explained.

For the goal of breaking this barrier and helping in enforcing the Democratization of Artificial Intelligence, we, [@GDSCUIZ](https://gdsc.community.dev/university-of-ibn-zohr/) and [@TFUGAgadir](https://www.meetup.com/TFUGAgadir), ought to create this series of events fully presented in Moroccan Darija, to introduce our attendees to the general concepts needed to solve problems using Machine Learning.

At the end of the [#30DaysOfML](https://gdscuiz.github.io/30daysofml), our attendees will have a certificate indicating the number of events they did attend. And the attendees that finish all the assignments will be offered the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate) Voucher to pass the exam.

This [**#30DaysOfML**](https://gdscuiz.github.io/30daysofml) is split into 5 phases.

The first phase, [**#MLStart**](https://gdscuiz.github.io/30daysofml/events/mlstart), introduce the attendees to the basics needed to get started with creating solutions using Machine Learning.

The second phase, [**#MLReady**](https://gdscuiz.github.io/30daysofml/events/mlready), will get into more details about the application of machine learning in NLP, Computer Vision, and Time Series with TensorFlow.

After attending the [**#MLStart**](https://gdscuiz.github.io/30daysofml/events/mlstart) and [**#MLReady**](https://gdscuiz.github.io/30daysofml/events/mlready) and finishing the assignments before the deadline, students will be eligible to receive a voucher to pass the TensorFlow Certificate Program exam (Limited Number, Sponsored by [**Google Developers**]()).

Then the [**#MLDeploy**](https://gdscuiz.github.io/30daysofml/events/mldeploy) will focus more on Machine Learning models deployment in the Google and TensorFlow ecosystem.

Then the [**#MLInnovate**](https://gdscuiz.github.io/30daysofml/events/mlinnovate), where we will host Machine Learning practitioners to learn how they use ML to create impactful solutions.

Lastly, as part of the [**#30DaysOfML**](https://gdscuiz.github.io/30daysofml), we did launch the [**#MLOlympiad**](https://gdscuiz.github.io/30daysofml/events/mlolympiad) Kaggle competition, where participants try to create Machine Learning models to **classify** whether a genome sequence belongs to **Humans** or **Gorillas**. 

> The top 3 teams will receive swag prizes sponsored by **Google Developers**.
