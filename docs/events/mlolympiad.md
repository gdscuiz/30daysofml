## ML Olympiad:  Genome Sequences Classification

### Goal of the Competition

The goal of this [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ml-olympiad-gdscuiz-and-tfugagadir
) is to accurately classify genomes by building a machine learning model.

### Context 

Every living being has a set of chromosomes that depicts its characteristics and features. These chromosomes are composed of nucleotides: A, C, G, and T. Also known as DNA genomes. The complete list of these nucleotides is called a genome sequence. 

Since a genome sequence is different for every living being, the ability to determine the species of the organism from its genome could be very helpful for research and biology-related works. However, it is difficult to perform this task without comparing the DNA of this organism to the DNA of creatures of the same species.
From another standpoint, our current technology is not near enough for us to fully understand the genomes and the genetic codes, which are the basis of every organism.

Launching this competition might open further possibilities and doors on this topic. It will allow AI enthusiasts to hone their skills, and contribute to the field of biology. As well as utilize ML/DL-based technologies to classify genome sequences of different given species.

The participants will have to create models to classify the genome sequences of Human vs Gorilla based on their genome sequence. 

Individuals or groups of up to three people are allowed to participate in the competition. 

This is a Code Competition. Refer to [Code Requirements](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ml-olympiad-gdscuiz-and-tfugagadir/overview/code-requirements) for details.
