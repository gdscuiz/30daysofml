# #30DaysOfML

Welcome to the [@GDSCUIZ](https://gdsc.community.dev/university-of-ibn-zohr/) & [@TFUGAgadir](https://www.meetup.com/TFUGAgadir), [30 Days of Machine Learning](https://gdscuiz.github.io/30daysofml).

One of the hurdles that hiders self-learners is the language barrier. Instead of focusing on understanding the knowledge required, the learners put great effort into just understanding a single sentence of what's been explained.

For the goal of breaking this barrier and helping in enforcing the Democratization of Artificial Intelligence, we, [@GDSCUIZ](https://gdsc.community.dev/university-of-ibn-zohr/) and [@TFUGAgadir](https://www.meetup.com/TFUGAgadir), ought to create this series of events fully presented in Moroccan Darija, to introduce our attendees to the general concepts needed to solve problems using Machine Learning.

At the end of the [#30DaysOfML](https://gdscuiz.github.io/30daysofml), our attendees will have a certificate indicating the number of events they did attend. And the attendees that finish all the assignments will be offered the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate) Voucher to pass the exam.

You can join the training by registering and joining our [@GDSCUIZ](https://gdsc.community.dev/university-of-ibn-zohr/) chapter from [here](https://gdsc.community.dev/university-of-ibn-zohr/), or by joining [@TFUGAgadir](https://www.meetup.com/TFUGAgadir) on meetup from this [link](https://www.meetup.com/TFUGAgadir).
